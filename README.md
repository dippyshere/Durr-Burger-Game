Since this game is based of the mini game, I've tried to stay faithful to as many aspects as I could, this includes sound extracted from the game, some altered to fit as they did in the game. All images were recreated in Illustrator. These images were then compressed with http://compress-or-die.com/ and https://compresspng.com/. The font 'Burbank Big Condensed' and the 'Burbank' font is trademarked and copyrighted by House Industries.
